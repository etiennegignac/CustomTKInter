Hardware wiring:

Touchscreen is running a Raspberry Pi with GPIO to control IO through Python.

For seat control: RPI can control relay board directly (do we need a logic level converter??)

For drivetrain display, RPI communicates with Arduino through modbus

RPI needs to have minimalmodbus installed.
RPI is the master and doesn't have data available.  Other modules are slaves with different IDs, they make data available.

ID: 10 - Transfer case controller
